Welcome to the [Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab](https://dogcog.unl.edu)! 

This lab is led by [Jeff Stevens](https://jeffreyrstevens.quarto.pub/), Susan J. Rosowski Professor in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.unl.edu/) and the [Center for Brain, Biology & Behavior](https://cb3.unl.edu/) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](http://www.unl.edu/).

## Mission statement  {-}
**The mission of CCHIL is to understand how dogs behave and process information in their world as well as how interacting with dogs influences human behavior and psychology.** 

CCHIL is committed to robust, transparent, and open science in all of our research endeavors and to disseminating our work to the general public via outreach activities.

## Lab priorities {-}

* The safety, security, and well-being of lab personnel, human participants, and animal subjects.
* An inclusive working environment that respects diverse perspectives; seeks empathic understanding of diverse experiences, including discrimination, bias, and privilege; and fosters opportunities for underrepresented students to participate in science.
* The integrity and transparency of data and the replicability of data analyses.
