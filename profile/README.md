Welcome to the [Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab](https://dogcog.unl.edu)! 

This lab is led by [Jeff Stevens](https://jeffreyrstevens.quarto.pub/), Susan J. Rosowski Professor in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.unl.edu/) and the [Center for Brain, Biology & Behavior](https://cb3.unl.edu/) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](http://www.unl.edu/).

**The mission of CCHIL is to understand how dogs behave and process information in their world as well as how interacting with dogs influences human behavior and psychology.** 

CCHIL is committed to robust, transparent, and open science in all of our research endeavors and to disseminating our work to the general public via outreach activities.

Our GitHub account maintains our [lab manual](https://unl-cchil.github.io/cchil_lab_manual/) as well as repos for the data, analyses, and reproducible materials for our studies.
